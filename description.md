## Game Description / Ideas
you wake up in your house
you remember reading something inspirational last night and decide you want to git gud; however, you turn around to look at your current situation and realize you have a long way to go

before you do anything else, you gather some type of resource for around a minute and use it on some upgrade/crafting an item

after that, the game tells you there is a grocery shop 20 meters from your door
your goal is to buy some type of starting equipment at the grocery store, but while buying stuff you will be attacked by some fruits (invoking juice's idea from earlier)

potential resources

tangible/material resources:
food
- alternatively, we can make it so that there are many different types of food, but the player needs to eat them manually
wood
metal
currency

### how to gain food
buy stuff from the grocery store
you can also learn how to grow food by yourself in your backyard
### how to gain wood
cut trees in the forest
### how to gain metal
early on, metal mostly comes in the form of scrap which you can find by exploring streets or neighborhoods
later i guess you can make mining a thing
### how to gain currency
you get to work temporarily at certain locations, which pay you every day after work
