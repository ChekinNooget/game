### Game Description / Ideas

you wake up in your house
you remember reading something inspirational last night and decide you want to git gud; however, you turn around to look at your current situation and realize you have a long way to go

before you do anything else, you gather some type of resource for around a minute and use it on some upgrade/crafting an item

after that, the game tells you there is a grocery shop 20 meters from your door
your goal is to buy some type of starting equipment at the grocery store, but while buying stuff you will be attacked by some fruits (invoking juice's idea from earlier)
